# Problem Statement
The Terrorism Database contains information about terrorist attacks worldwide. It includes details such as the date, location, attack type, weapons used, number of casualties, and responsible groups. Your task is to create a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of global terrorism trends and patterns.

# Step 1: Data Import
Open Power BI Desktop.
Select "Get Data" and choose the appropriate data source, such as CSV or Excel.
Load the Terrorism Database into Power BI.

# Step 2: Data Exploration and Cleaning
Explore the dataset in the Power BI Navigator.
Identify missing values, duplicates, or irrelevant columns.
Use Power BI's "Transform Data" functionalities to clean and prepare the data.

# Step 3: Data Modeling
Define relationships between tables, linking relevant fields.
Create calculated columns or measures that may enhance analysis.

# Step 4: Designing Visualizations
Design key visualizations such as:
A time series line chart to show trends in terrorist incidents over time.
A geographical map pinpointing attack locations.
A stacked bar chart illustrating attack types.
Pie charts for the distribution of attacks by responsible groups.
Heatmaps for visualizing concentration in specific regions.

# Step 5: Building Dashboard
Create a new dashboard in Power BI.
Add the visualizations created in Step 4 to the dashboard.
Arrange and resize visuals for a clear and intuitive layout.

# Step 6: Implementing Interactivity
Use Power BI's interactive features to allow users to filter data dynamically.
Add slicers for parameters like date range, attack type, and region.
Utilize drill-down features to provide detailed insights.

# Step 7: Adding Insights
Include text boxes to provide contextual information or key insights.
Add tooltips to visuals for on-demand information.

# Step 8: Testing and Refinement
Test the dashboard to ensure that all visualizations are working as intended.
Refine visualizations and layouts based on user feedback.
